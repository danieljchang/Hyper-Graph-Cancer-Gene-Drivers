Final Project for 02-731.

In this project, I attempted to model how over the course of generations given a random walk, we could see which genes would take over given their interactions. I then applied a change using hypergraphs. The goal was to use a set of genes to better understand the relationship given a group of genes and how they interact with another group of genes. Usnig a random-walk was the most common method of traversing through a hypergraph.
